# Vehicle Counting and Speed Estimation using YOLO and SORT

This project demonstrates vehicle counting and speed estimation using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for tracking the detected vehicles in a video stream.

Here is the link for breakdown and casestudy for this project [Vehicle Counting Blog](https://github.com/shahrul-amin/Blog-Vehicle-Counting-Using-Yolo-And-Sort)
